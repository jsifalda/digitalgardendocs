> [!WARNING] Netlify Issues when deploying a new site
> As of 21. January 2023 this there are some issues with Netlify, and "Deploy to Netlify" button described in [[Getting Started/01 Getting started\|the getting started turorial]] won't create a copy. If that happens you will get an error when trying to deply your site. If this happens, there is a workaround for this step  [available here](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/issues/167#issuecomment-1399222123)


> [!faq] Vercel/Netlify build fails after [[Getting Started/06 Updating the template\|updating the template]]
> Most of the time this is due to the plugin not being updated before updating the template. Try updating the plugin in Obsidian to the latest version, and then try updating the template again.
