## Slugify Note URL
The plugin "slugifies" your URLs by default. In essence this means that a note with the path "My Folder/My Note.md" will get the URL "my-folder/my-note". 
You can disable this by turning this setting off. 

> [!faq] Non-English Characters
> Slugifying the URL causes some non-English characters, like Chinese characters, to disappear. Resulting in all notes getting an empty URL. If you've experienced this issue, disabling this setting should fix that.
