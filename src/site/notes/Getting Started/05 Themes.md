Out of the box the digital garden has a simple dark theme applied. But the plugin supports using the community Obsidian themes. This can be changed in the [[Getting Started/04 Appearance Settings\|04 Appearance Settings]].


Style settings are not yet supported. This is on the roadmap and will be added sometime in the future.
