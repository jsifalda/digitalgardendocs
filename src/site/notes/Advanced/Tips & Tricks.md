Here are a collection and tips and tricks that can be of use when publishing your notes. 


## Publish excalidrawing
If you want to publish a excalidrawing, without having to transclude it into another note, you can simply add the dg-publish: true flag to the frontmatter of the excalidraw file. It will then be published as a standalone note, with only the excalidrawing showing. 

## Publish all notes in a specific folder
Some people have requested functionality for publishing all notes in a given folder. To do this, you can combine this plugin with the Templater plugin to create folders which will automatically use a template having the dg-publish attribute set.
