The plugin supports publishing dataview query result. Simply publish a page containing a query. The plugin will render the result as it is at the time of publishing. If the result changes, you will need to republish that note.

Note that Dataview JS queries are **not** supported, due to limitations of the Dataview API. 

As the plugin "freezes" the result and publishes it, you'll actually even see the links from a dataview query as backlinks. 

You need to have version 0.5.39 or later of the dataview plugin installed for this to work.
